# NBA Over/Under Prediction Project

I'm building a Python-based model to predict NBA game totals and eventually recommend Over/Under picks using real data and machine learning. This is an ongoing project that I will update daily to track progress and show consistent development.

### Current Status (Day 1)
- Project folder + Git setup
- Fetched raw NBA game data using `nba_api`

### Next Step
- Convert raw data into a clean, one-row-per-game dataset

### Tools (so far)
- Python
- `nba_api`
- `pandas`

### Goal
Predict total points per game, compare to sportsbook line, and output **Over**, **Under**, or **No Bet**.
