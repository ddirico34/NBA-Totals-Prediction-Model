# NBA Over/Under Prediction Project

I'm building a Python-based model to predict NBA game totals and eventually aim to achieve at least 60% accuracy on Over/Under picks using real data and machine learning. This is an ongoing project that I will update daily to track progress and show consistent development.

### Progress Log

- **Day 1** – Project setup, environment fixed, and raw NBA game data pulled with `nba_api` starting from 2020-2024
- **Day 2** – Combined multi-season data, built a one-row-per-game dataset, and trained a first baseline model (MAE ≈ 13.6 points).


### Tools (so far)
- Python
- `nba_api`
- `pandas`

### Goal
Predict total points per game, compare to sportsbook line, and output **Over**, **Under**, or **No Bet**.
